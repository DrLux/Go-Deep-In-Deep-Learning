# Go Deep In Deep Learning #

I realize that I could start from scratch and go beyond the exam, becoming really confident in this field. So I prepared a plan for 2 years, taking the best online courses that I found from Coursera, Khan Academy, Google, fast.ai, Mit... following them during my study at university.

In the follows paragraphs I make available all my personal notes, all my solved questionnaires with relative scores (all with 100% but I covered my solutions to respect the honor code on Coursera) and a screenshot from each programming assignments.	

You can have more details on my [blog](https://drlux.github.io/go_deep.html)

# Machine Learning by Andrew NG #
This course is perfect for a beginner. Is the best introduction, it's not required other particular skills (but if you need clarification on linear algebra or statistical I recommend you Khan Academy) and allow you to do a lot of practice. After this course, I have a full understanding of this topics and I'm able to implement them (but only in Matlab. Next step is to learn the more advanced topics and programming them in python).

# Neural Networks for Machine Learning by Geoff Hinton #
I realized that I was losing my time without increase my skills. Of course, I  learned a lot of new things but i'm not able to replicate them in code, I think that 4 programming assignments in 16 weeks are too few and that the arguments must be explained in more details to have a full understanding of them. This course is not for beginners or intermediate students of machine learning. Most appropriate as an overview of the field by a master that experts and practitioners may find interesting.So i'm am un-enrolled after 8 weeks of 16.
