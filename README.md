# Go Deep In Deep Learning #

I started a Master Degree in computer science and in parallel I started to studies deep learning from online courses. I prepared a plan for 2 years, taking the best courses that I found from Coursera, Khan Academy, Google, fast.ai, Mit...and i plan to follow them during my study at university. I make available all my personal notes, my solved questionnaires, and my programming assignments. You can follow my path step by step and take what you need, whether they are explanations, cues on which courses to follow, or source code of the projects that I will develop when I have enough knowledge.
